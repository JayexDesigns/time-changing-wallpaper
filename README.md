<p align="center">This is a javascript webpage that changes its background depending on your local time</p>

<p>I found a set of images of a landscape from The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker made by Matt Vince, I made the javascript code to make the images change depending on your local time. Later on, I also added an audio visualizer and sea sparks animation by request of some users.</p>
